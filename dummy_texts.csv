9ddf1293-b1d6-5221-8fac-7e8d78c6d3ab,"I'll play almost anything, once. How much further play the game sees is largely about how much I don't like it. When it comes down to it most games are at least playable. So this review will start with a game description, move to what I don't like, and finish with whatever I think is outstanding. So... Kingdoms How's your linear algebra / matrix multiplication? Take turns placing values of -6 to +6 into a 5x6 grid, or placing one of your scoring markers. At the end of each round each scoring marker scores x1 to x4 the total of the row and column it's in. Hey look! There's castles and ogres and things painted on the pieces! (I wonder what that's for?) If you reckon you know your way around how Kingdoms works, you can skip the Contents and Rules Overview, and go down to the guts of Notes On Play Feel, What's Not To Like, and What Stands Out. Contents (Fantasy Flight edition) + The board ... four giant interlocking jigsaw pieces which make a grid of 5 x 6 squares. + Monochrome rulebook in seven (!) languages. Each language is two pages. + Eighteen Value Tiles (2 ea of 1 to 6, 1 ea of -1 to -6) and four Special Tiles (2 ""mountains"", 1 ""gold mine"", 1 ""dragon"") + Player's Scoring Markers, which are multipliers... four colours each having four x1s, three x2s, two x3s, and one x4 + Victory point Gold counters (cardboard disks) Production quality is really really basic, but it'll do. Everything is heavy cardboard. Printing is misaligned, the colour quality is fairly poor. The (unrelated) fantasy/medievil artwork is dark and brooding and for me detracts from playing the game. I find the box inset pretty much useless. The rules are simple (elegant?) enough that it would have been hard to get the rulebook wrong. Kingdoms Rules Overview (You can of course skip this bit.) Objective score the most points total over three rounds. The board is a 5x6 grid of squares. In each round, each square will end up with one Tile or Scoring Marker in it. Each round ends when the grid is full. Setup is really quick. Choose a colour each, take the player's Scoring Markers of your colour, assemble the jigsaw board (ok maybe setup isn't quick) and take some start victory points (because it's possible to score negative). Each player takes one face down Tile, looks at it and keeps it secret from the other players. The remaining Value and Special Tiles are placed face down near the board as a draw pile. Each turn a player puts one thing on the board. Any one of + A Tile drawn randomly from the remaining Tile draw pile (which will be either a Value Tile or a Special Tile) + Their secret Tile (not secret once played, and the player doesn't draw a new secret Tile) + One of their remaining Scoring Markers Although there's not much choice in what to play, the player chooses which vacant space in the grid to play into. Players take turns until the grid is full. The grid is then scored. Each Scoring Marker is worth its multiplier times the total value on the Tiles in the same row and column as the Scoring Marker. (This might be negative.) After scoring, any x2 to x4 Scoring Markers that were played are removed from the game, and the Setup is (otherwise) completely reset for the next round. (Players can re-use x1 Scoring Markers in subsequent rounds.) Special Tiles... Mountains block the flow of scoring. A Score Marker doesn't score any Value Tile that's ""on the other side"" of a mountain. Dragon cancels the value of any positive Value Tiles in its row or column. Negative Tiles still score. Correction: Note the Tiles are not affected for scoring as they appear in other rows and columns, only the total for the Dragon row and column are affected. Gold Mine doubles the Value Tiles in its row and column. Correction: Again, the Tiles are unaffected regarding other rows and columns, only the total for the row and column containing the Gold Mine are affected. Variants are included in the rulebook. Notes On Play Feel Kingdoms is kind of like tic-tac-toe on steroids with stock options and bonus spinners thrown in for good measure. I shouldn't say ""thrown in"" since the inclusion of the Special Tiles is by no means casual but is carefully calculated in the usual Knizia style. Each Tile changes the potential Value along an entire row and column, and that row/column may cross another high potential column/row. But any time you set up a high potential location in the grid, your opponent/s get first crack at it. You cannot usually deliberately set up a winning combination for yourself during most of play. The only mitigations to this are... + in a two player game... Note that a high scoring Tile at row 3 col 2 creates joint potential twice with a high scoring Tile at row 5 col 6... the two points being row 3 col 6 and row 5 col 2. In a 2P game you and your opponent can get one each. + near the end of a round, you can see what Tiles are remaining and who can play where. Sometimes there's an opportunity to exploit the Tiles running out forcing people to play Scoring Markers, or situations where all remaining Tiles are eg negative. Like a massively complicated tic-tac-toe, Kingdoms can be largely a game of reactive survival. Don't open high-leverage possibilities, and don't expose yourself to high-leverage vacant spaces (unless most/all the -ve Value Tiles are already played.) Most playing seems to be about leaving the board as balanced as possible, and then jumping in with an appropriate Score Marker on the rare occassions when your opponent is forced to unbalance the board. You can try to set up highly negative potential spaces and force your opponent to play a Score Marker, but it's hard to engineer deliberately. So What's Not To Like? Personally I'm currently avoiding this game. Here's some possible niggles... It's Completely Abstract / Dry. Q: Why did they even bother to theme this? A: Because even for an abstract game this would be dry dry dry. As dry as the game ""Sprouts"" in a drought. The Artwork Sucks is Unappealing. Entirely a subjective opinion of course. Is it Random? I still haven't worked out if the random elements totally dominate this game. Sure, it feels like I'm probably making meaningful choices, but the choices are pretty much driven by just trying to survive. You can't afford to offer anything on the board in Kingdoms. You can't set up a future win. And the first time you get a bum Tile it's all there for your opponent. Or they happen to draw the <PERSON> just when you put out your x4. Analysis Paralysis can easily happen here, as you try to work out if perhaps you can set up a future win. Surely it must be possible... it's so clearly a mathematical game. It's Another Knizia. Yeah, one of those. It's 120% maths and 30% spatial. (Maybe you can guess why I don't enjoy this so much?) Why Is It Even Boxed? You can set this up in Excel pretty easily. Very Strong Player Order Binding. The player after the poorest player should usually win. For me that makes it a 2P game. You Don't Win. You don't win at Kingdoms. You just try to be the player that did the least losing. So What Stands Out? Brain Burning analysis is a distinct possibility. Sure you can ""knock this out"" in about 20 minutes, but you can also lapse into deep contemplation of the potentials on the board. Quick and Light is also a distinct possibility. If you choose to yield your psyche to the random forces at work then much responsibility is off your shoulders and you can take an approach of ""I'm <PERSON> partner... I'll do what I can with what she gives me"". It's a Knizia. You can be sure the maths is right. My Wife Asks To Play! Ok my wife is not your partner. But any game that can prompt her to ask for a play gets at least a little thumbs up in my book. I think this is because the rules are plain enough that she got comfortable with them quickly. She wins her share. Portability is pretty good. The box is small enough already. You can even play this on a plane on your way to Egypt. (Or wherever you're going.) (Experience suggests that for plane trips you should leave the ""gold"" counters at home and score on paper.) Socially Acceptable or perhaps even a newbie ""draw"". I took this to the office one day and three different people wanted to know about it. (Albeit that I work in a financial institution among actuaries.) From there I was able to introduce some more fun things. Overall... well you probably caught my drift by now. It's mathematically interesting, frustratingly tantalising in teasing you with the idea you can set up a win, finely balanced in its basic framework to the extent that the Special Tiles can sometimes be killers. This game begs more brain burning analytics than I want to give to something which I think is so dominated by luck. Kudos to those who can play it as a light game... that's probably the way to enjoy it. Don't get me wrong, I can play a game or two. But I choose something else."
b0625f39-67e9-5f79-a91d-adae765d7e7e,"This may be my first review on BGG, and it appears I may be the first person to post a review for this game, so . . . no pressure. But hopefully you find this useful in deciding whether to buy this game. Background I have been gaming for over 30 years and at this stage of life, I game almost exclusively with my wife. So board games compatible with playing with two players is my sweet spot. We enjoy Pandemic (including Pandemic Legacy Seasons 1 and 2, Season Zero, not so much), Race for the Galaxy and lately Terraforming Mars. We have also played Dominion and Spirit Island, though we stopped because one or the other did not enjoy it so much. After playing the heck out of TM, including buying and playing most of the expansions, I was looking for a new puzzle to solve and did a LOT of research. Things that I like in a game are, in this order: theme, smooth mechanics, multiple ways to win and replayability. Many games have good mechanics, but I just can't get into the theme (many traditional Euros fall into this category for me). Raising sheep to ship to market, blah, blah, blah. BOOORIIIIING. But anything too ""take that"" and the wife will not be amused. She really hated the first few times I bombed her plants with asteroids in TM until she learned to do it effectively herself . . . anyway, that's a story for another post. So after much research I finally landed on Maglev Metro. It had a lot of things going for it, which, now that I think about it, let's get started with the review, shall we? Overview I will start with the obvious stuff. MM is a pick up and deliver system where the goal of the game is to accumulate the most victory points by: (a) laying track, (b) delivering commuters to their stations and earning points (and there are different ways to do that), and (c) scoring end-of-game points based on four special VP cards you draw at the beginning of the game. When you ""deliver"" a commuter to a station, you place it on your board. Where you place it determines how it will be scored at game end. Some ways of scoring points are constant. For example, you always score 1 VP for each link (station-to-station connection) in your track network. However, there are bonuses available too. For example, if you deliver one of each type of commuter and put them in the right slots on your board, you get a bonus VP for each track link. The VP cards also give you bonuses, some of which gives points per, say, each curved track on water in your network, while others give bonuses for track tiles you DIDN'T lay. So depending on what you draw, different strategies suggest themselves. Mechanics So how does it work? You start with a train at a station (duh) and begin by laying track and then building stations. The locations where stations may be placed are fixed on the board (they are the inset hexes on the double-thickness board), but how you connect to those stations and what stations go where is determined by play and varies each game. (Some VP cards provide bonuses for directly connecting certain kinds of stations, which can affect your decisions on what stations to put where.) You get a free passenger when you build a station. Early on, the free passenger is a free robot, which you can use to build your engine. Later when you unlock the commuter stations and place one of those stations, you get a bonus commuter. That commuter can also be used to build your engine (in a limited way) or to start scoring VPs. So tension is created between engine-building and VP scoring, which is how it should be. So what are robots you ask? They are passengers you use to build out your engine. Want to be able to lay more track per turn? Drop a silver robot in your ""lay track"" slot. Want to move faster? Drop a gold robot in your ""move"" slot. There are also slots for train capacity (the total passengers your train can hold), pickup capacity (the number of passengers you can pick up with one move), drop-off capacity (the same as pickup capacity, but in reverse), refill station, adjust, build station and reverse train. You can also fill out rows with robots or commuters to gain a third or even fourth move per turn. But be careful! Commuters used to grant additional moves do not count toward VP scoring. So again, tension. Is the extra move worth it to be more efficient? It will obviously depend on whether your opponents are Hoovering-up commuters or whether you feel you have time to collect them later. A word about player interaction. There isn't a lot of it, but you have to take into account what your opponent is doing when deciding your moves. Is your opponent collecting pink commuters? Are there still several pink commuters in the bag (you draw from a bag filled with the remaining passengers as part of the ""refill station"" move)? If the answer to both questions is ""yes"", you probably don't want to do a ""refill station"" action as your last action, especially if your opponent's train is in the same station just waiting to scoop them up. Your track network cannot be blocked by your opponent. Players' tracks can occupy the same hex, even if they are going in different directions. Your opponent can build a station you were planning to build and plop it at the opposite end of the board from you, which is a little annoying, but usually not a big deal. There are two of every type of commuter station, so you are usually within a short distance of one of the two. To sum up, the mechanics work smoothly and everything is fairly intuitive once you understand your options and how they work. One rule that you will mess up several times in the beginning is the one which limits you to two tracks coming out of each station. You will want to branch out of the same station in a spoke-and-wheel fashion, but that is the challenge to figure out how to build without violating that rule. Components The components are high quality and simply beautiful to look at. The map board where you place the tiles and stations, and the player boards where you place your passengers, are made of high quality, thick cardstock and the colors and art are very well done. The passenger meeples are made of wood and are sturdy. One complaint many have is that it is hard to distinguish the colors of, for example, the gold and copper robots. Also, the lilac commuters and silver robots look very similar depending on the lighting. Our solution was to use a Sharpie to draw a distinctive line across the gold robots and a dot on the purple commuters - problem solved. The track hexes are clear with straight and curved track lines of different sizes - which allows one player's track to be laid over another player's track without obscuring the track below. A brilliant design choice and they are made of good, sturdy plastic. It is sometimes hard to fit the plastic track hexes between the cardstock stations, but I can only imagine it must be hard to get those dimensions exactly correct. It works just fine in practice. Finally, the trains are perfectly sized to hold the meeples and are made of a nicely weighted metal bottom with a plastic top. It feels very satisfying holding one - it scratches that ""toy"" itch. What I love about Maglev Metro MM's mechanics fit the theme very well, it presents interesting decisions and tension between engine-building and VP scoring, provides for minimal - but still relevant - player interaction, and plays in 30-45 minutes for two players. You can easily get in two sessions in an evening. There is a good deal of variability with the VP scoring cards being different each game. Some games end up being very low scoring (around 30-38 points) while some are very high scoring (my last game I scored a 96!). We are learning better and better ways to build out our networks with each play. And we've only played the Manhattan side of the board! (There is a Berlin map on the opposite side.) We've played this game probably 20 times and it's nowhere near getting old. About the rules - they are pretty straightforward and, at least so far, we have not run into any situations (apart from a VP card) for which we could not find the applicable rule. Some have said the VP cards could use an index, which is a fair point. Things I wish were Better About Maglev Metro There are no variable player powers. Each player plays and scores victory points in the exact same way, with the exception of the VP cards. It would have been nice if the different train lines had varying abilities so that the played differently. Each player gets a default of one robot per action. They easily could have given one player two robots in the ""lay track"" action so that line lays track faster, for example. Perhaps this could be added in an expansion. Of course, you have the ability to customize your train as the game progresses as you accumulate robots, so you can play your own preferred style as you wish. So maybe this isn't a big deal. Some of the VP cards are just frustrating. One requires you to never unlock two types of commuters in order to score 10 points. That is a HUGE sacrifice because there are so many ways those commuters could be used to score you points. 10 points seems hardly worth it to give up all of that. And sometimes the VP cards require you to do contradictory things. One may give you points per lilac and purple commuter you have on your board while another may require you to never unlock the purple commuters. I guess that's tension of a sort. But it definitely limits your options when you get cards that not only have NO synergy, but actually cannot be played together effectively. Conclusion I definitely recommend Maglev Metro to anyone who likes an efficiency game with variable ways of scoring that can be easily played in under an hour. It fits a great niche for us for nights when I don't feel up to the full 3+ hour marathon game of Terraforming Mars. Game components: 10 Theme: 8 Game mechanics: 8 Depth: 6 Final score: 8/10"

Summary Game Type - Racing Game Play Time: 30-60 minutes Number of Players: 2 – 5 (Best 4+) Mechanics - Hand Management, Modular Boards Difficulty - Pick-up & Play (Can be learned in 10 minutes and only takes 2-3 plays to get a handle on the thinking required) Components - Excellent Release - 2008 Designer(s) - <PERSON> -( Antics!, Antler Island, Dragonscroll, Poseidon's Kingdom, Savannah Tails, Shear Panic, Spellbound) <PERSON> -( Antics!, Antler Island, Dragonscroll, Poseidon's Kingdom, Savannah Tails, Shear Panic, Spellbound) Overview and Theme Snow Tails is a racing game that uses the unique and quite fun theme of husky sled racing. It comes to us from the Lamont Brothers who have brought us other uniquely themed titles such as Antics, Antler Islandand Shear Panicto name but a few (all of which feature animals interestingly enough). I actually began writing this review (all but finished it rather) back in 2011 and for whatever reason it was lost amongst my files. Having found and returned to it in 2015, the benefit of time allows me to state that the Scottish brothers have gone in a different direction since this release...preferring to design lavish and limited productions as opposed to larger scale ones like Snow Tails. Snow Tails is largely about hand management skills as each player aims to control their sled through various obstacles and around corners by playing cards. Some of the mechanics used are similar to those found in other racers but as a package Snow Tails does manage to deliver a unique and enjoyable gaming experience. It should also be noted that Snow Tails has been released by and , with both versions featuring a different box. Whether the components differ in any great way I am unsure but the images on offer would seem to suggest not. Then in 2013 a new edition was released called. This release fell in line with the limited edition releases that the <PERSON> Brothers now seem to prefer and as such is very difficult to find. The key difference in this release appears to be the inclusion of 3D components such as chapels, lighthouses and the like. Images Courtesy of farchamb, JayB and <PERSON> This review will be looking at the 2008 labelled release and seeing what the game has to offer in the Racing Game sub-genre. The Components The <PERSON> Brothers (<PERSON> and <PERSON>), who are Scottish, have really created a game that looks wonderful, even when the components are relatively simple (compared to their recent releases). Track Tiles – In all there are a total of 16 double sided track tiles with which to build the tracks featured in the rulebook or to create your own custom designs. The tiles are of a lovely thickness and the artwork really evokes that sense of snow and ice and all things Northern Hemisphere. Each tile is adorned with lines to help identify who is leading in close situations and then there are more subtle additions such as flags, little buds and some numbers, that all play a role in regards to one mechanic or another. You really get the sense that Snow Tails was designed with passion and not just rushed out to market to make a quick quid. As a game lover I appreciate that. Image Courtesy of <PERSON> Templates – The next most important component are the Sled Templates, which are actually quite sizeable. But they need to be because they allow space for Dog Cards to be played onto your sled and Brake Markers to be placed their also. Image Courtesy of cnidius Dog and Dent Cards – Driving the play are the Dog cards. These come in decks of 20 and each deck is coloured to match the sled of each player. Each card depicts a top down view of a Husky doing their thing and each card features a value. In a nice artistic touch the top of each card features the eyes of a Husky looking at you…which kind of piles on the pressure to look after them. The Dent Cards (see image in middle of review) simply feature a banged up sled with some just visible fir trees in the distance. Artistically they are simply designed to remind you of how much you suck at this sled racing thing. It should be noted that these cards are smaller than the standard playing card. I think they would be comparable to the cards that featured in the original editions of Ticket to Ride. Image Courtesy of cnidius The Wooden Bits – The lovely wood of Snow Tails comes in the form of the player sleds and the fir trees. The sleds are coloured to match the Dog Cards taken by each player and the fir trees are a fitting green. Image Courtesy of <PERSON> Brake Tokens – The last major component are the Brake Tokens, which feature a single value each and are designed to fit into the back of your Sled Template to indicate the amount of control you are trying to exert over your sled. Whilst unnecessary, a nice touch is that the value of each token is flanked by a pair of legs in orange racing pants. When the markers are popped into the slot of the sled it creates the visual of you as the racer standing behind the sled. Image Courtesy of binraix Rules – My version of the game came with 5 individual booklets to cover a variety of languages. The rules themselves are excellent indeed, being very clear throughout, offering nice visual examples and the rules are layered in a way that makes them easily understood. There are one or two spelling errors here and there and the occasional grammatical error but what game doesn’t have those? One thing worth noting about the rules is that they do offer a fair degree of humour and puns related to the terminology of sled racing and Husky Dogs. It is not quite as ‘laugh out loud’ worthy as games like Galaxy Trucker but it is welcome. I have not read other rulebooks from but I imagine this is a common theme with them and it is nice touch. The final thing to note about the components is that a 'Big Paws' tile is included with the game. This is to be given to the player that takes the longest time to make their move. If you read the name of the tile again you will likely get the joke. I expect that I will be holding this tile in most of my games. Image Courtesy of zombiegod All in all Snow Tails receives an excellent rating for its components. A big to the designers, publishers and the design team as a whole. Image Courtesy of Riptcord Set-up Like many a racing game, Snow Tails is based around using a specific track and the game offers up 7 designed tracks for the players to race on. But thanks to the modular board segments it is entirely possible to create customized tracks. So step one is obviously to select or create a track to race on and this may require some tree tokens to be placed if a Sapling Section of track is in play. Each player then takes a Sled, Sled Template and a deck of Dog Cards (all of which will be of matching colour). Once their deck is shuffled, each player draws 5 cards to create their starting hand. Each player must take a Brake Marker of value 3 and place it in their Brake Marker slot on their Sled Template. All other Brake Markers and the deck of Dent Cards are placed within reach of the players. The final step is to determine the starting player order and in turn each player selects a starting position on the Start Tile of the track. If playing with 4 or 5 players they will receive +1 or +2 cards in their starting hand respectively. This slight advantage at the start is to make up for the fact that they will likely have a less desirable starting position and have to contend with traffic ahead of them. The Game Play The aim of Snow Tails is simple enough, to be the first past the finish line at the greatest speed (this may sound odd but I’ll explain it in good time). So how do the players get their sleds around the track? Let’s take a closer look at the core mechanics and how those Huskies affect the play… The Flow of a Turn – Image Courtesy of henk.rollemanOn a single turn a player will – a) Play between 1 and 3 cards from their hand. b) Move their sled according to a set of rules (which I’ll get to in a moment) c) Draw cards to return their hand to 5 cards On the surface the game is as simple as that. Play Order – Like Formula De/D the order that players take their turns is dependent on their track position, with the most advanced player going 1st for a new round and so forth down the line. Should two players be level on the track then they will be separated by their position relative to the next upcoming corner. The player that is on the inside of a corner or on the inside lane of a straight as it approaches the next corner is deemed to have the best racing line and gets to go first. If two players are on a straight as they approach the Finish Line (i.e. there is no upcoming corner), then the player closest to the side of the Finish Line with the checkered flag icon is deemed to be in the more advanced position and gets to move first. These are small considerations but they can have big consequences on the final result of a race. Husky Power and Sled Science– The core concept driving the movement of a player’s sled is the notion that there are two Huskies pulling your sled. Your ability to keep them in balance (in terms of relative speed) will determine how straight your sled travels. Your overall speed is determined by the speed of the combined Huskies less your Braking value. Sled Balance and Card Play – When a player plays cards, they can play a card to one of the Husky spaces on their Sled Template (cards simply get placed on top of one another) or to both Huskies. If the dog on the left has a value of 3 and the dog on the right has a value of 5 then your sled will be forced to drift 2 spaces to the right this turn. It is also important to note that a player can chose to drift their required number of spaces at any point during their move. This can allow them to avoid trees, other sleds and other hazards with careful maneuvering. Whilst Snow Tails can be semi-punishing at times, it does also reward skillful Mushers (I think that is the term for a Sled Driver?) If a player has a perfectly balanced set of dogs they can opt to use a speed bonus, which is equal to their current position. So a player in 2nd place could move an additional 2 spaces, whilst a player in 4th could gain a whopping 4 extra spaces. This is fairly awesome on the straights…but could be dicey in a corner as no drifting is allowed when using the bonus movement (which is always taken at the end of regular movement)…but then again it is optional. Speed and the Brake – A player’s speed for the turn is determined by adding the power of both dogs and subtracting the Brake pressure being applied. So if your Huskies had the cards 3 and 4 and the Brake was at a value of 2, then the speed for that turn would be 3+4-2 = 5. Do not forget though that a player can play from 1-3 cards in a single turn, and a single card can be played (discarded) to change the value of the Brake Pressure, whilst leaving the dogs alone. When this is done the player simply takes a Brake Token that matches the value of the card discarded and places it on their sled. In this way the players have some control over their speed. The speed of a player must be moved in full unless they collide with something. The Catch – Now this may all seem rather easy to manipulate, but there is a pretty neat mechanical catch. When a player plays their cards for a turn, they are only allowed to play multiple cards if they are of the exact same value! This will have major implications from one turn to the next, especially when the challenges of the track are factored in and it really makes the hand management aspect of the game very important indeed. Cornering – Good racing games try to replicate the importance of corners in some way and Snow Tails is no exception. Here it is called the Safety Speed and it is the maximum speed that a Sled is allowed to go as it enters into a corner. Should a player exceed this speed then they will be taking some damage. Dent Cards – Image Courtesy of zombiegodAnd damage is dished out in the form of Dent Cards. Whenever a player exceeds the Safety Speed of a corner they will earn Dent Cards equal to their excess speed (if you moved 6 going past a Speed Limit of 4 then you earn 2 Dent Cards). These cards are simply added to your hand but they form part of your hand limit of 5 cards, so in effect they actually reduce your card options for future plays and in a hand management game this is bad news. Those familiar with many a game will realise that this pretty much replicates the damage mechanic used in RoboRally. The only difference here is that a hand limit of 5 is much more punishing than the 10 cards afforded by . You have been warned. Because Dent Cards can never be played or discarded from a player’s hand, acquiring a 5th Dent Card effectively means that you have smashed your Sled up so badly that you are out of the race…and your Huskies are likely to break free and decide that fending for themselves in the wild is preferable to sticking with a loser like yourself. The Implications for Screwing Up – There are effectively 3 ways you can screw up in Snow Tails. a) Speed Limit – As already discussed, exceeding the Speed Limit as you enter a corner will earn Dent Cards. b) Hitting another Sled – Will see your move end immediately and you will not be able to draw back up to 5 cards at the end of this turns. This effectively makes the following turn darn tricky, but you will get to return to 5 cards at that point. c) Colliding with the side of the Track – This unadvisable course of action will result in a player’s turn ending immediately. They must take a Dent Card but they are then allowed to draw back to 5 cards (remembering that Dent Cards do fill card slots in relation to hand size limits). Advanced Play – Once players have a good grip on managing their sleds they can then look to the more advanced track obstacles such as Saplings (trees), Snow Drifts and the Chasm. All of these features have their own little quirks that need to be negotiated and they can add a lot of fun to the mix…in much the same way that expansions do…there is more chance for carnage. For the record a promo board was also released called . It is a single section of track with a gaping crevasse that requires a sled to be travelling at a speed of 5 or greater to clear its gaping maw. It's not essential but can be a little bit of extra fun. Winning a Race – One final point that needs to be mentioned is that winning a race of Snow Tails is not a simple case of crossing the line first. Instead the winner will be the player that crosses the line first, but if two players manage to do that in the same turn, the trophy will go to the player that advances the furthest past the line. This is a nice touch as it really rewards the player that planned their end game 2 or 3 turns earlier. What Makes Snow Tails an Enjoyable Experience? Simplicity vs. Interesting Decisions – This is by far Snow Tails greatest strength. It doesn’t try to overcomplicate the racing game genre and this makes it easy to learn. But too simple and a game can lack tension. The combination of mechanics in Snow Tails does a wonderful job of creating interesting decisions for its players and requires them to think a turn or three ahead to put themselves in the best position to glide to the line. Thematically Appealing – Snow Tails is appealing because it is not only unique but there is something inherently appealing about Husky Dogs and even cute, for those disposed to that term. That cute factor could be the edge that a gamer needs to attract their significant other to play a game with them…and a racing one at that. Now please don’t go flaming me for that comment, I am not trying to be sexist in any way and I know that we have highly intelligent ladies that play games far more complex than this…and I love you for it. But the fact remains that many a gamer has a partner that isn’t into their hobby and Snow Tails has a fairly good chance of getting them to at least try a game, based on its theme alone. And of course my comment regarding partners works for both male and female gamers alike. Gradual Learning Curve – Image Courtesy of punkin312Snow Tails is also rather clever because the recommended track designs found in the rulebook have been created so that each new advanced element is introduced one at a time. This allows the players to build their skill with the core mechanics, whilst only having to learn a new rule, or face a single new challenge with each play. It’s About the Fun and not the Fame – By this I mean that Snow Tails is really about the fun that is had during the course of a race, rather than the end result. A game with skilled players where no one incurs any damage is going to be far less enjoyable. For most, the fun to be had is in seeing a player frak up their sled by going through a corner at ridiculous speed and having another sled get familiar with how much junk is in their friend’s trunk! This is why I think the game is best with 4-5 players. More sleds equal more interaction and the chance for calamity. Time Friendly – Unlike some racing games, Snow Tails is a fairly quick experience at somewhere between 30-60 minutes. Whilst I love a game like I really have to set aside a day (3 odd hours) to dedicate to it. Snow Tails doesn’t have that problem. Family Friendly – The combination of all of the above points means that Snow Tails can be a really fun family friendly title. Kids, parents, aunts and grandparents can all enjoy this game together without getting too confused or losing half a day. The speed and brake mechanics though could be a little confusing for the under 10 set so I would hold this back if your little ones are below that threshold. Variety – Because Snow Tails uses modular board pieces it allows experienced players to create their own track designs to torment their fellow players. Whilst I don’t think quite as many track designs are as possible here as a game like Powerboats allows, it is certainly a welcome addition and prevents the need to buy additional tracks like does. Something for the Hard Core – For those gamers that do like to play a game to within an inch of its mechanics, Snow Tails does offer just enough to keep you interested. It takes some skill to maneuver your sled at good pace through the more challenging obstacles, sled position does matter at critical moments and blocking off other player’s movement options is possible. It is important to plan those endgame moments 2-3 moves ahead if you want to pass the post by the greatest possible distance. Weaknesses? Skill Imbalance – Due to that last point it should be said that a skilled or experienced player of Snow Tails is more likely to wipe the floor with more casual players on a regular basis, so there can be an imbalance there…but then again that could probably be said of most games. This is mostly due to the fact that casual or first time players will really only be worrying about the current turn or perhaps the one after that, whilst the skilled player will be thinking 2-3 turns ahead and considering how they need to manage their hand and braking speed to give them the best chance to win. The Speed vs Brakes Dilemma - Unlike some racing games that use dice for movement, there is a real knack here in playing your cards just right to maintain speed, slow down for those Speed Limiting Corners and maneuvering just right. At times a player simply won't be able to manipulate their hand to get the drift they need and drop or increase their speed at the same time. The game really requires some careful consideration. Runaway Leader Issues - In the games I have played (and I would regard myself as a skilled player by any stretch) there has been on the issue of a runaway leader on several occasions. Now this may well be a consequence of a skill imbalance but in truth we were all pretty unskilled. It really came down to some players getting the right cards at the right time and getting ahead of the pack to avoid a bottleneck. Sometimes a player also needs to know when going full throttle and taking a dent card is worth the risk to keep with the lead pack. That isn't easy to know when first playing. This can create a situation where the excitement of a close finish is not present and that isn't desirable in a racing game. But it doesn't happen all of the time. The Final Word I’m really happy to have experienced Snow Tails and have it in my collection to this point. Like many of my gaming buddies I still prefer a to this but that is simply our gaming bent coming through. I prefer that game because there is more interaction and carnage due to a larger field of racers but Snow Tails is a great example of the 'thinking gamers' game and in the time frame that it can play in, it is a winner. The unique theme and the blend of mechanics it brings to the table is really good. I most appreciate its application of subtle mechanics and its ability to play in a reasonable length of time. I almost feel like it has been forgotten by the Geek as I rarely see a post about it these days but then the Racing Genre is a competitive beast and newer titles are stealing all of the attention at present (see and ). Until next we meet, may all your Huskies be pure breed and your sleds glide smoothly.

5fec0970-86ff-5f16-a461-7aff77ce46f5,"Descent: The Well of Darkness is an expansion to Descent: Journeys in the Dark. That being the case, my review will assume that you have a grasp of the base game and will only tackle what this expansion adds. I will address each addition with it's own section. New Heroes Well, the first thing you generally do for a game of Descent is pick your heroes. And Well of Darkness (WoD) gives you 6 new heroes to take into the dungeon against the hordes of the Overlord. Each of these heroes is rather unique as the designers have found interesting ways to make ""fresh"" character abilities (while at the same time avoiding making them over/under powered). For example, there is a barbarian who can't wear any armor but gains ""armor"" for each melee trait bonus he has (very themey). Each character makes you want to choose them and play a quest right there and then; from the teleporting wizard, to the archer who can change her targets after rolling the dice, all the way to the stumpy dwarf who is slow but always gets to move two spaces regardles of what action he takes (great for a battle action when you are within a step or two of some enemies). Of course, these new heroes were accompanied by corresponding models on par with the ones that came with the base set. In my opinion, the new heroes are a great addition and exceeded my expectations. Like I said, each one is unique and brings something new to the table that the base set heroes did not. New Monsters The other pile of plastic you recieve is for the new monsters the overlord has at his command. Three new minions are made available with WoD: Kobolds, Ferrox, and Golem. Kobolds take their seat at the very bottom of the monster food chain. They are very weak, but come in large numbers. Each one has the swarm ability which adds black dice for each other monster having swarm adjacent to the target of an attack. This can actually start to add up and I have seen Kobolds take down a weakened hero (though this would be an exception to the rule as they are generally swatted away like flies by the heroes). The master <PERSON> also have the trickster ability which lowers the cost of traps played by the overlord as long as they are somewhere in the dungeon. This puts the heroes in an uncomfortable position as they try to decide if it's worth it to hunt down a little kobold or let him play in the shadows and make traps show up more often. Very fun. Second up in the food chain is the Ferrox, which are basically beastmen are steroids. They are pretty well armored and have a decent ammount of hit points. Most importantly, they have the Bleed ability, which is quite nasty. After wounding a hero with an attack, the hero recieves a bleed token. At the start of the hero's turn, he rolls a white die for each bleed token and takes the corresponding damage with no reductions for armor. This can be quite powerful, as a hero low on health can die from a bleed token at the start of their turn and basically lose that turn. Additionally, the master ferrox have the leach ability which saps it's victims of fatigue while healing the master ferrox. It can be useful, but it's not quite as cool as bleed. Finally we have the golem. He's a real tough monster that fits in fairly high on the monster food chain. His high armor and hit points should keep him around for a few attacks against bronze and silver treasures. His ironskin ability can really come in handy as it allows him to ignore a slew of special abilities, most importantly pierce. Overall, the new monsters are great. The Kobold and the Ferrox add the most to the game as their abilities really spice up the action. The golem is really cool (and fun to spawn), but he doesn't change the dynamics of the game as much as the other two. That being said, it's nice to have a tougher monster out there that the heroes simply can't pop with one shot. Overlord Cards While the new heroes and monsters are great, I found that the most important addition to the game is the new overlord cards. Each quest now has a point system for three different categories: Event, Trap, and Monster. Before the game, the overlord spends these points to buy WoD cards for the corresponding categories. These cards replace overlord cards from the base game as the overlord player sees fit. Each of the WoD cards is more powerful than the base game overlord cards. For example, a beastman spawn card will now spawn an extra regular and master beastman. Other cards include more deadly traps, like scrything blades which cause bleed damage, to a posion dart feild, or even an <PERSON> styled rolling ball. These cards make playing the overlord much more fun. It's great to customize your deck to play the style you like to play. Additionally, the simple fact that the heroes don't know what you have picked really keeps things fresh and keeps them on their toes. This single element added way more than I realized it would after reading the rules online. After playing the game and drawing the ""Summon Golem"" card, it's hard not to let out an evil laugh as you are now privy to some information and the heroes have to try and guess what you're cooking up for them. Item/Skill/Replacement Cards WoD also comes with a rather large stack of item, skill, and replacement cards. Item cards include new shop items and new treasures. The shop items are a welcome addition as they allow the heroes to outfit themselves with greater variety. Especially welcome are the new runes which open up more options for the magic users in the group. The new treasures are what you would expect: cool new toys to make opening chests even more fun (as if it wasn't fun enough). The new skill cards also serve to keep things fresh. By expanding the possible skill combinations, heroes are likely to feel fresh and interesting everytime they are played. Again, this is a very welcome addition. Least exciting in this category are the replacement cards. These simply fix mistakes, clarify wording, or adjust balance (making the shop Bow better or the skeletons a little more effective). Though they aren't as ""cool"" as new treasures, they do make welcome tweaks to the game that appear to feel ""right"". Overall, the cards are very nice (albiet expected). My one complaint concerning the cards is that they seem to be cut from a different die than my base game. This makes them stick out a hair and can be problematic with shuffling. This is a problem when it comes to the overlord deck as you can tell when a ""special"" card is coming up. As a simple fix, I have put all my overlord cards in sleves and all is well. Misc Rounding out the rest of the box, you'll find more map tiles, tokens for a new effect (daze), new terrain tiles (mud and lava), a bolt template, and a rulebook full of fun new quests. All of these are done up to par with the original game. They all expand a little bit, but they really aren't ""the meat"" of the expansion and I don't consider them worth going into much. The new quests are probably the best of this bunch are they are varied and bring cool new problems for heroes to solve. Conclusion (read: my opinion) This expansion is very, very well done. The Well of Darkness has done wonders to keep my dungeon play sessions fresh and exiting. The new overlord deck has gone a long way to make playing the overlord more fun and ""sinister-like"". The overall balance of the game seems to be tilted more toward the ovelord with this expansion, as we find tougher monsters (ferrox), cool tricks (Overlord cards), and really tough quests. Anyone thinking that things were too easy for the heroes needs to give WoD a try. I've seen seasoned heroes get mopped up by a good overlord in many of the WoD quests. Bottom line: Buy this expansion if you have the base game. It's an expansion that goes well beyond just giving you more ""stuff"". Sure, it gives you lots of ""stuff"", but the ""stuff"" is well thought out and backed up by intersting mechanics that change the game for the better."
dfa95651-e99c-5027-ac74-6ad60c2ea2ec,"This is my first review so be gentle... Picked this up in a Tangathon about 5 weeks ago. Had never heard of it before then; in fact hadn't heard of BGG either, so I got one board the whole BGG thing rather recently. I've played quite a bit of Civilization, Diplomacy, Titan, Samurai Swords (well *my* copy is called Shogun) and a couple other older games, but not in a while due to not having many people to play with/crappy work schedule. The reviews said this was a great wargame for people who didn't like wargames, and that it was fairly quick to play. I'm recently married to a non-gamer (well, she likes Scrabble and party games), but she'd enjoyed Hellas which has some vaguely war-gamey aspects to it (in that you have little men and you invade and control territory). Anyway, sounded like a great way to lure her one more step down the path to full blown games of Diplomacy, Axis and Allies, etc. The Components The board is very very nice, as are the hexes you put on top of it. The pieces are of good quality, *but* the two colors (green for Allies, Grey for Axis) are very hard to tell apart at a glance. We've reached for each other's pieces more than once. I appreciate that the colors lend themselves to the military theme and that hot pink and blue, while easier to tell apart, would have changed the tone significantly, but some kind of nice tan, or a lighter green or something would have made it a bit less confusing to surcey the board. The cards look nice, but they are kind of flimsy; after about a dozen plays, they are already taking on a permanent bend and getting nicked up around the edges. The dice are good. They are a little rounded so they have the tendancy to go rolling off the table sometimes. Here they seem to realize the importance of color differentiation and the different symbols all look quite different. The Rulebook Very well done. Quality paper-stock. Nice looking. Well layed out. Good examples. It also comes with reference cards, but a reference sheet (or better yet 2) would have been easier to deal with. The cards tend to get mixed in with the actual play cards, and you have to kind of flop through them looking for the one you want, which is not appreciably easier than just looking the manual. Printed out the reference sheet from BGG and that works great for my wife (who has more trouble remembering the rules than I do due to not investing/wasting so many hours of her life at much more complicated games). Getting Started This game was fun right from the beginning. It was simple enough that my wife picked it up pretty quickly, at least from a mechanics standpoint. We took turns on each scenario, playing once on each side. She actually beat me on both sides the first two scenarios, which one can attribute to luck, her quick learning, or the fact that I suck at tactical games on some sort of fundamental level, or more likely some combination of those three. Point being the rules were simple enough and the cards limited options enough to allow her to be competative right away (to be fair, I did tend to point out when she did something blatantly foolish). I also appreciated how the first three scenarios get gradually more and more complicated, perfect for learning the game. Replayability Well, we are about halfway through the original 12 scenarios (we actually played Sword Beach twice on each side), and they are varied enough to keep it interesting. Even if we only played those 12 scenarios twice each, the game was more than worth it, but of course there are many scenarios available on their website, plus expansions, and some of the scenarios my wife has definitely expressed an interest in trying again now that she is starting to understand the strategy (ok ok ""tactics"" sheesh) better. Overall In short, I found this game to be, as advertised, an excellent way to introduce a non-gamer into something that has at least the sheen of a wargame. I find myself interested in obtaining some of the other Commands and Colors titles (Battlelore, Ancients), which I've heard are a little more complex. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who even suspected they might be interested in it. 8.5"
d7e602d7-a5e8-5d03-9cff-3b48b2fa95e9,"Disclaimer: You will not find a rules summary within this review. Welcome to the Jungle A little over a year ago I found myself in an expansive game shop in Austin, Texas. I had just moved from the Mid-West to attend graduate school at the University of Texas and was eager to get a sense of the local gaming scene. To say the least, I was impressed. The game store itself covered a wide range of genres with an apparently even hand, almost refusing specialization. Additionally, the back room swarmed with gamers gleefully playing games that carried that same catholic scope. Among the groups I watched several players engage in a pirate game, which, when set against the sleek components of the other tables, seemed laughable. Little folded tents marked sugar mills and fleets, and small hand cut paper cards crowded around the tiny board. I’ve never been that enchanted with a nice set of components and so the game’s rudimentary appearance seemed bold and beckoned me. The game was <PERSON> 2006 game, Lords of the Spanish Main. I sat speechless for an hour as I watched the story of the 17th Century Caribbean unfold with immense detail. When I expressing some interest in the designer, one of the players pointed me to different table where another of his games, Origins: How We Became Humanwas in full swing. Little did I know I was witnessing a cosmic aberration: two <PERSON> titles were being played at the same time, in the same place. A few hours ago I had hardly heard of this man and now I seemed to be surrounded by acolytes. Origins pulled me in with the same force of the other title and my mind eagerly soaked in the plethora of information that littered every component. I promptly plucked copies of some of his games off the shelves and gleefully biked home to explore them. The rules were dense, heavily footnoted affairs, and I’d be lying if I said they were easy to learn. Nevertheless, undaunted, I assembled a few friends together to give the games a spin a few weeks later. To my surprise, they were incredibly easy to teach. Once understood the concepts were remarkably easy to convey to the other players and soon the turns flew by and we reenacted the birth of human consciousness and high jinks in revolutionary Mexico. Moreover, long after the games were packed away my friends and I continued to discuss the stories they told and the world our little counters, cubes, and tents, represented. You might then imagine my eagerness when, a couple of weeks ago, a package was placed at my door. <PERSON>’s first entry in the Bios series had arrived. Bios: MegaEuro The Bios Series provides space for a revamp of some of <PERSON>’s earlier titles as well as some new ones as well. When stitched together all the games will attempt tell the story of life on earth from before it existed, till after it leaves. Along these lines, Bios: Megafauna is a redux of <PERSON>’s earlier American Megafauna. American Megafauna is a much more expansive, marathon of a game which, though covering a similar area, takes between 3 and 4 times as long to play. Despite its fans, AMF’s new edition had languished in the pre-publication queue of a company which did not seem to have the time to give the title justice. Several fans interested in a potential new edition, including myself, shot out emails asking <PERSON> when a new edition might crop up. He responded by bracketing production of the series chronologically first title, Bios: Genesis, in order to redevelop AMF. Anyone who plays <PERSON>’s games chronologically will surely note the growth of ""European game mechanics"" in his later titles. And, unsurprisingly, <PERSON> was clear about his desire to make AMF more accessible through a greater abstraction with these tricks as well as a totally new, professional set of components. On these counts Bios: Megafauna delivers. The card, counter and map design are fantastic. Though I’ve got some qualms with choice of typeface, and layout, this is easily one of his prettiest games and holds its own in today’s marketplace. Though it might not carry the dense (overwrought) graphical motifs of most modern game graphic design, <PERSON> rightly opted on the ""science textbook"" look for his game. What other choice could possibly fit without anachronism a game whose turns represent two million years? Additionally, <PERSON> gives his players wicked cool meeples that come in eight varieties (four different mammals and four different dinosaurs) which represent different animal families. These little wooden trinkets will likely provide a big draw to those who are not enchanted by <PERSON>’s other graphical choices, and it certainly helped me convince many prospective players to give the game a shot. <PERSON> also deserves considerable praise for picking a box of the correct size to hold his game’s components. Everything fits snuggly, with just enough room for printed copy of the latest set of rules. Not that the game’s original rules are bad in execution, mind you. By <PERSON>’s standards I think these rules measure up nicely to the high standards of Lords of the Spanish Main in clarity. I did miss the High Frontier style glossary in the back but I understand that deep, informed footnotes are necessarily a selling point for everyone and the game does include some very nice notes as is. However, despite these strengths everyone purchasing this game needs to be aware of the living rules. Thankfully I had been stalking the discussion on the yahoo group for several months as was aware of a couple of changes that were made shortly after the game was printed. Principally (for those of you reading who don’t have a copy of the living rules) is the addition of the action, ""Roadrunner Club,"" which allows the phasing player to pay two genes to the leftmost card on the display and then advance on one of the roadrunner tracks. This nicely smooths the effects of poor display draws which otherwise stall the game. Not that poor draws don’t happen on occasion. Any group worried about card draws might easily come up with a representative selection of cards for the era decks to insure a limited number of catastrophes and the like but we’ve found that such atypical draws tell interesting stories in and of themselves. In a recent game a spell of poor draws whittled down the number of biomes to perilously low numbers and earth nearly became both hothouse and snowball in the same game. You say you want an Evolution? Though I’ve previously alluded to the scope of this game, it bears repeating. Bios: Megafauna is epic on a scale unparalleled by any other game I’ve ever played. Though it may not be as long as Empire in Arms, or as detailed as ASL, Bios: Megafauna simply dwarfs the competition (even among games like Dominate Species). Every single action in this game represents a cool two million years with each card draw illustrating the passage of ten million years. A prospective buyer might rightly wonder how, given this scope, the player could represent anything of value within the game. In this game the players themselves nominally represent different animal species grouped into families by their placeholder cards. Throughout the game they will start new families and come to guide a whole range of animals through their evolutionary history. However, it might be easier to think of players as representing rational action and the passage of time itself. Like many of Sierra Madre Games, Bios: Megafauna demands that players understand the rules that created the world as we know it and must act within their boundaries. Species that have prospective feeding grounds will expand in that direction. There is of course room for strategic play, but such considerations work beneath the surface of the game’s central story arc which seems to characterize such clever play into a moment of historic chance. Speaking of clever play, evolution games generally misrepresent the process of evolution by transforming the acquisition of traits into a RPG style level bonanza where, in the end, super creatures wander the earth, unable to be stopped by any circumstance. <PERSON> dodges this in two ways. First, the game operates with a closed currency where each ""dollar"" represents genetic diversity. DNA augmentations are paid to the selection of random mutations on the display with these ""genes."" This keeps the players roughly at par with each other’s chances of scoring a useful mutation. Secondly, overspecialization is a recipe for disaster. Throughout the game various catastrophes will hound creatures with a litany of DNA traits, encouraging players to keep it simple and establish a diverse range of species. Furthermore, the more specialized a family is, the more of its tokens must be used outside of the biomes, which limits its expansion e.g. your super advanced and culture dolphins may have achieved every cultural bonus but they’ve only got enough pieces left to be in one bio and when victory points roll around, they aren’t going to be able to match your ubiquitous husking sloths in the fossil record. Of course, those culture spots will give you a bonus in final scoring. But, like other <PERSON> games, timing the explosions and collapses is at the heart of the game. Don’t be alarmed with a catastrophe wipes out half the map; know that those destroyed biomes will ossify your species and ensure that critters immortality within the fossil record. After the Quake When I packed up for my winter break at home, Bios: Megafauna made the cut. Despite, or perhaps because of its theme, the game has managed to pique the interest of many who had little curiosity in board games in general until they played this game. Simply put, this game deserves a general audience with the scientifically inclined minds. The last few weeks have seen numerous plays with a very diverse set of gaming groups. Just last night I played a three player game with my fiancée and her mother and we had a blast trying to survive a very hostile Earth. While it does require some effort to learn, it can be a pretty easy game to teach. I find it’s best to start with the goal of population growth, then describe what a biome is and who can live there, then move right to the actions and use them to explain the different types of DNA and the other facets of the game. Don’t bother to talk about acculturation or even predator/herbivore contests until the first few rounds have passed and they become more relevant. The replayability is unbelievable. Though certain parts of the game are scripted, the diversity of biomes and cards allow for a tremendous range of worlds and creatures. Additionally the possibly of a linked mega game with Origins and High Frontier should be a big draw for anyone curious about a way we might have gotten to be who we are today, and where we might be going. I’ve long been interested in the proto-discussion around games as a communicative art form, and I’ve thought hard about reading the games of designers like <PERSON> as ""texts"" in the critical sense. But if anyone deserves a critical treatment it’s <PERSON>. His games are explicit statements that provoke debate and learning. Bios: Megafauna has a lot to say about evolution, it’s true, but it also speaks to the power and scope of the game form and it’s a message worth listening to."
